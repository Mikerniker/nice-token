# SPL Token Creation on Solana

This repository is a submission for the MLH (Major League Hacking) challenge. The objective of this challenge is to create a new SPL token on the Solana blockchain. 
In this challenge, I learned how to create SPL tokens using the Token Extensions program, including how to utilize the token metadata extension.
