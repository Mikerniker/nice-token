# SPL Token Creation on Solana

This repository is a submission for the MLH (Major League Hacking) challenge for Global Hack Week: Web3. 
The objective of this challenge is to create a [new SPL token on the Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/how-to-create-a-token). 

In this challenge, I learned how to create SPL tokens using the Token Extensions program, including how to utilize the token metadata extension.
